SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception 

# Description: 

This method configures the security filter chain using the provided HttpSecurity object. It disables CSRF protection and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow unrestricted access to all HTTP requests. 

 # Parameters: 

http (Type: HttpSecurity) - The HttpSecurity object to configure the security filter chain. 

# Returns: 

(Type: SecurityFilterChain) The configured security filter chain. 

# Annotations 

@Configuration: Indicates that this class is a Spring configuration class. 

@EnableWebSecurity: Enables Spring Security for the application. 

# Beans 

UserDetailsService userDetailsService 

# Description: 

An instance of the UserDetailsService, which is used by the DaoAuthenticationProvider for user authentication. 

AuthenticationProvider authProvider() 

 # Description: 

Creates a bean of the DaoAuthenticationProvider that provides authentication support for the application. 

SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) 

# Description: 

Creates a bean of the SecurityFilterChain to configure the security filter chain for the application. 

# Usage 

The AppSecurityConfig class is used to configure security settings for the Spring application. It defines the authentication provider using the DaoAuthenticationProvider, sets the user details service, and configures the security filter chain to disable CSRF and CORS. 

Please ensure that the necessary user details service is implemented correctly and provided as a bean to the AppSecurityConfig class. Additionally, customize the security configuration as per the specific requirements of your application, such as defining URL-based access controls, authentication mechanisms, etc. 

Package: com.backend.server.configuration 

# Description 

The SwaggerConfig class is a Spring configuration class responsible for setting up the Swagger documentation for the backend server. It enables the Swagger API documentation for the Spring application, allowing developers to interactively explore and test the API endpoints. 

Methods 

Docket api() 

# Description: 

This method creates a Docket instance to configure the Swagger API documentation settings. It specifies the type of documentation (SWAGGER_2) and selects all request handler methods (@Controller annotated classes) and API paths for documentation. 

# Returns: 

(Type: Docket) A configured instance of the Docket for Swagger API documentation. 

# Annotations 

@Configuration: Indicates that this class is a Spring configuration class. 

Beans 

Docket api() 

# Description: 

Creates a bean of the Docket class, which is the main class used to configure and customize the Swagger API documentation. 

# Usage 

The SwaggerConfig class is used to enable and configure Swagger API documentation for the Spring application. It sets up a Docket bean with basic configurations, including selecting all request handler methods (@Controller annotated classes) and all API paths for documentation. 

To use Swagger in your application, follow these steps: 

Include the necessary dependencies in your pom.xml or build.gradle file to support Swagger, typically including springfox-boot-starter or springfox-swagger2 and springfox-swagger-ui. 

Create a configuration class similar to SwaggerConfig, which sets up the Docket bean. 

Customize the Docket bean according to your application's needs. For example, you can add more API information, group APIs, apply global headers, etc. 

Once the configuration is in place, you can access the Swagger documentation by visiting the Swagger UI URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) when your application is running.

Please note that the actual Swagger documentation will include information about all the API endpoints available in your application, and developers can use it to understand the available APIs, test them, and interact with the backend server.
